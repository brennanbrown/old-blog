## History

This blog was originally started in 2015 on [Medium](https://medium.com/brennanbrown) called _Everyday Essays_ after I graduated from high school, after years of telling myself _"I really wanna start a blog!"_

Since then, I have migrated to WordPress with the name Wander Notebook, (still available to view [here](http://wandernotebook.com/)) to now self-hosting on GitHub using a bare-bones layout and design I made myself, under the name [Notebook Casa](https://brenblog.netlify.app/).

With no expertise or formal education, I have written a multitude of posts on various topics over the years. My most frequented topics are happiness, creativity, productivity, and writing itself.

You can view a visual, graph-based history of posts on my [Beeminder](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/blog).

## Purpose

Many people will tell you that the communicative medium of blogging died out many years ago, replaced by more convenient, short-hand modes of interaction and technology.

I am on a quiet, reluctant fight against that. I believe that people should take a step back from the privately-controlled, information-overloaded platforms of social media that have monopolized the internet and instead carve out a piece of digital real estate for themselves.

Although the age of (poorly designed) Geocities and Livejournal are over, people still have a unique voice that should thrive independently, and not rely on the handful of websites that everyone uses. The Internet is for everyone.
