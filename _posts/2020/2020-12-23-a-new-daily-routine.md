### 10 New Habits to start off 2021 with!

There can be a sense of being overwhelmed when trying to form new habits. One solution I’ve found to be helpful to counter-act the feeling is translating these new habits into a one-page document outlining what I ought to be doing each day. Included are links to other related and helpful articles I’ve written!

[I developed such a document before,](https://brennanbrown.medium.com/everyday-manifesto-4abe02363c33) and although was pretty good, it was more rooted in nebulous ideals that weren’t directly connected to an output such as [quantitative measurement of progress](https://towardsdatascience.com/tracking-for-good-db4809c9f456) and action. As such, these daily actions weren’t really accomplished that well or at all most of the time, so I decided to update them accordingly:

1. **Start today off right! Do good and be meaningful — Try your best. **Wake up early and make your bed as soon as you get up. Clean your room. Listen to upbeat music and visualize what you’ll be doing for the day. Try to prepare as much the night prior, as well as make sure you have a healthy breakfast.

1. **Meditate on intentionality. Plan the day effectively and minimally.** Prepare a to-do list of the most important tasks that need to get done today. View all long-term goals and make sure you’re making progress towards them. Section out different parts of the day for different activities. [Don’t waste time — it’s limited.](https://brennanbrown.medium.com/our-finite-everything-8ed4d9d70a2f)

1. [**Generate ideas, research important topics, draft and edit good writing.](https://writingcooperative.com/my-writing-process-4868f986f97f) **Document how you feel and what your plans are for the day, as well as the progress being made. Research, draft, and publish articles and blog posts. Archive all work. Keep track of poetry, prose, and other creative work being written as well.

1. **Focus on deep work, effective tasks, and [self-education](https://brennanbrown.medium.com/guide-to-self-learning-7ea651650d11).** Prioritize time to your most important tasks, namely learning and working. Ensure progress is being made in [classes both online and in real life](https://dev.to/brennan/8-cheap-or-free-learning-resources-j1j). Large amounts of time should be dedicated to tasks that make progress towards goals.

1. **Be grateful for what you have, stop and breathe — Take stock of it all. **Focus on the many good things in life, as well as contemplate where you’re able to do better and improve. Relax, slow down, breath in and out, and think of the bigger picture. Take time to recite morning affirmations or prayers, memorize them.

1. **Eat Healthy and Eat Less — [Practice veganism, sobriety, and OMAD.](https://medium.com/@acraftystitch/one-meal-a-day-omad-has-brought-me-internal-peace-quiet-b601e9685644)** Be mindful of what you’re eating, and only eat at the dinner table. Look over cookbooks for inspiration and add items to your recipe box. Don’t waste money or calories on junk food or eating out. Take time for spiritual fasting as well.

1. **Keep yourself active, stand up as much as you can, work out often. **Maintain physical fitness on a daily basis. Take some time out of your day to go for a jog, practice at-home routines. There are plenty of opportunities to get active.

1. [**Practice frugality — You already have everything that you need.](https://brennanbrown.medium.com/actually-matters-7561d31c18d)** Don’t waste your money or your time, you have less of both than you think. Don’t shop unless it’s essential, and don’t do things that aren’t essential to do, unless you enjoy doing them. Figure out ways to maximize both each day.

1. **Archive everything meaningful and important into [the Commonplace](https://medium.com/carre4/reclaiming-the-internet-454be2125154).** Don’t let the important and interesting slip away easily. Save everything you find throughout the day in one place, and categorize these things consistently.

1. **Just Relax! Have fun and play. Don’t just work all day.** Don’t forget to spend time on creative projects, as well as wind down at the end of the day. Spend as much time on [analogue activities](https://brennanbrown.medium.com/the-importance-of-analogue-a90eebcc9d86) as you can.
