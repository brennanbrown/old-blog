### 8 Resources for Career-boosting Certification!

As I’ve written about in the past, the world of [MOOC](https://www.mooc-list.com/) (Massively Open Online Courses) has become a fiercely large phenomenon. Below is an article I’ve written about creating a system that will help you stay productive and disciplined when partaking in MOOCs, and it will be updated soon:
[**A Comprehensive Guide to Self-Learning**
*How to unlock the full potential of a new era of education.*brennanbrown.medium.com](https://brennanbrown.medium.com/guide-to-self-learning-7ea651650d11)

Of course, in retrospect, I’m very glad that I’ve been focused on making online learning work — with nearly all non K-12 education being virtual and remote now. In some instances, this has resulted in [having students thriving](https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-are-some-kids-thriving-during-remote-learning) with the new experience.

On the other hand however, there has been [sharp criticism](https://c2cjournal.ca/2020/09/we-need-to-talk-how-remote-learning-is-ruining-university-education/) regarding how colleges and universities are responding to this transition. For many institutions, the price of tuition has remained the same in spite of the stark difference in experience.

Which is exactly why I’ve put together **this list of resources** where you can gain certification that you can put on your CV/résumé, with emphasis and priority on the most inexpensive and valuable material currently available.

### 3. [Coursera](https://coursera.org/) / [Google IT Certificates](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/google-it-support) ($49/mth)

While there are many choices of courses to take on Coursera, a majority of their catalogue is either available for audit or rather expensive for a final assessment. However, they have recently collaborated with Google to provide affordable IT certification, with more [coming out in the future](https://grow.google/certificates/).

A. **IT Support Professional Certificate**: This certificate prepares you for an introductory-level role as an Information Technology Support Specialist, whether that’s doing in-person or remote work, at a small company or a large enterprise organization. IT specialists solve technical problems at organizations of all sizes.

B. **IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate: **Building on your IT foundations to help you take your career to the next level. It teaches in-demand skills such as Python [(the most in-demand programming language by employers)](https://insights.dice.com/2019/10/08/python-java-top-languages-employers/), Git and IT automation. It also includes a capstone project, where you’ll use your new knowledge to solve a real-world IT problem.

### 4. [EdX’s Profressional Certificates](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate) (price varies)

EdX is similar to Coursera, in that they provide a large amount of different online courses, including [MicroBachelor’s degrees](https://www.edx.org/microbachelors) and the [XSeries](https://www.edx.org/xseries). In my opinion, however, the best bang for your buck and time are their pro certs.

The Professional Certificate programs are series of courses designed by industry leaders and top universities to build and enhance critical professional skills needed to succeed in today’s most in-demand fields. Find the program that meets your specific needs. Stand out and succeed at work.

### 6. [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) (price varies)

Udacity has a wide range of “microdegree” programs, in areas such as programming, data science, artificial intelligence, digital marketing, and more. Several of their programs are created in collaboration with large tech companies, such as IBM, Amazon, Kaggle, and more.

Compared to other resources, they are more pricey and intense with longer course lengths. But with the benefits of a student community, career services, interview preparations, GitHub profile reviews, and more.

## A New Technology?

Of course, since these resources are focused on helping you propel your career forward, this only really scratches the surface of what’s available online for those looking to get more education and learning.

For language learning, there’s [ClozeMaster](https://www.clozemaster.com) or [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com). For mathematics there’s [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). For programming there’s [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). It can be difficult to try and juggle such a wide variety of different tools and remember to use them consistently enough that they make a true impact.

That’s why I’ve been working on [**Self-teach Academy](https://selfteach.academy/), **a centralized dashboard for keeping track of your learning across multiple platforms automatically.
