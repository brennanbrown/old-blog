### & My Goals for the New Year

Around this time last year, I walking in downtown Calgary wearing only a dress suit in -30℃ weather, going from building to building, trying to find a service or program that could help me get employed. I had no idea what I was doing with my life.

Then, by sheer luck, someone offhandedly mentioned a program by the name [EvolveU](https://www.evolveu.ca/). That comment has changed the trajectory of my life.

Although I had originally gone to SAIT for information technology, I wasn’t able to finish the program. I had to take care of the financial burdens of my family and work instead. And I thought that I would never try to code again — it was a difficult field I did not have the luxury of time or money to dive into.

Being so grateful to earn a spot in the full-stack development program, I promised myself that I wasn’t going to squander it. I began to fully commit to self-improvement ([https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown](https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown)). I was going to make 2020 my year.

Of course, life had another idea. I was tested and pushed to my limits, like everyone else was. And although things didn’t go exactly how I thought they would, they still went surprisingly well.

I started learning French, playing chess, writing poetry again, taking care of my health, practising meditation, and most important to me — start creating open-source projects for others to use freely.

In 2021, I am aiming to become fluent in French, reach an ELO rating of 1700 in chess, publish a chapbook of my work, and officially start my own company!

Of course, there are so many other things that I wish I could have done, people I was hoping to meet, places I was wanting to go. But I hope that I made the most of what I could with the time I had. And I’m so grateful for everything I have in my life.

For 2021, I strive to do even more and accomplish many things that I’ve been yearning to get done for a long while:

## Goals for 2021:
