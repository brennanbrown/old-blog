In a world where it seems like everyone is trying to outdo each other with bigger and better accomplishments, it's important to take a step back and remember that success isn't just about external validation. It's all too easy to get caught up in the rat race and feel like we need to constantly be achieving something, but the truth is that what truly matters is what makes us happy and fulfilled.

Start small, and focus on doing things that bring you joy. Don't put so much pressure on yourself to be the most interesting person in the room, or to make a huge impact with every project you start. Instead, find contentment in the little things. Embrace the comfort of simplicity and take breaks when you need to.

Think about a small garden. It's a perfect example of what it means to start small. A small garden is cozy, manageable, and easy to maintain. It's the perfect adequacy of simplicity, and it's what makes it special. It's the same with our lives. We don't need to aim for grandiose goals and aspirations, we just need to find what makes us happy and go for it.

Starting small means taking the time to appreciate the little things in life and not being afraid to embrace the middleplace. It's about doing what you love, regardless of whether or not it will make you famous or rich. As long as you're doing something that helps others, or has a meaningful purpose, that's all that matters. So relax, take a deep breath, and start small. Enjoy the journey, and remember that success isn't just about what you achieve, but about the happiness you feel along the way.

There’s so much pressure to outshine everyone else — to be the most interesting person in conversation — but it’s all so ridiculous.

I’ve never cared about anybody that proudly lists their accolades, how fascinating your life amounts to doesn’t really mean anything. You’ll be a skeleton, too.

These are things that I need to remind myself of — that I don’t need to have a breakthrough each time I venture out to start something.

*Relax, already* — have some fun with it. If you aren’t willing to, then who will?

There’s no reason not to enjoy the cozyness of the middleplace. The perfect adequacy of a small garden over a complex & large orchid meadows.

So, start small. Do what makes you feel good, and then stop when it doesn’t. Take breaks often with delight. Stay small, if you’d like. As long as you’re doing something that’s helping others, or has a good meaningfulness behind it, that’s all that really matters — right?
