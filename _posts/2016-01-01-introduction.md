Here I am, writing my first blog post inside my cozy bedroom. Outside is the typical Canadian winter that I can luckily avoid by staying in and writing.

It&#8217;s a jinx to write up introduction posts, no question about it. Right below them<span class="_Tgc">—</span>nine times out of ten<span class="_Tgc">—</span>is a copyright footer. Too often do writers just abandon whatever project they had in mind right after the first post. You&#8217;ll never see an introduction written on a wildly successful website, it&#8217;s too full of other things.

Which I usually take as a tragedy, the matter of potential that&#8217;s been wasted. My mind wanders to the question to _where are they now?_, but this is a subject that I could write an entire post about.

And yet, there is a compulsive human need to write one up, and for me that&#8217;s trumped logic.

What&#8217;s the trick? Keep it short and sweet.
